        "CRITICAL: The highest level of severity, indicating a critical error or a problem that prevents the application from functioning properly. When a CRITICAL-level message is logged, it usually implies that the application cannot proceed and may need to exit or take drastic measures."

        "#### What is Multithreading?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads simultaneously. A thread is a sequence of instructions that can run independently of other threads within a program. Multithreading allows different parts of a program to execute concurrently, potentially improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads can be used in situations where multiple tasks or operations need to be performed concurrently. For example, if a program needs to perform heavy computational tasks while also handling user input or network requests, using threads can help ensure that these tasks don't block each other, allowing the program to remain responsive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `threading` module in Python is used to handle threads. It provides a high-level interface for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads. The threading module allows you to create Thread objects, start them, pause their execution, resume them, and perform other thread-related operations. It also provides synchronization primitives such as locks, events, conditions, and semaphores, which can be used to coordinate the execution of threads and avoid race conditions or other synchronization issues."

        "**Execution Model:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter. Each process runs independently and can execute its own set of instructions. Processes communicate and synchronize using inter-process communication mechanisms such as pipes, queues, or shared memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading: In multithreading, multiple threads are created within a single process. All threads share the same memory space and can access shared data directly. Threads run concurrently within the same Python interpreter and can communicate and synchronize using thread-safe data structures and synchronization primitives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parallelism**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing allows for true parallelism. Since each process runs in a separate instance of the Python interpreter and has its own memory space, they can be executed in parallel across multiple processors or CPU cores, utilizing the full power of the system.\n",
        "Multithreading: Multithreading achieves concurrency within a single process, but it doesn't necessarily achieve true parallelism. Due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, multithreading in CPython is often limited to concurrent execution rather than parallel execution. However, threads can still be useful for I/O-bound tasks or when using external libraries that release the GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory and Overhead:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Each process in multiprocessing has its own memory space, which means memory is not shared between processes by default. This isolation provides better stability but comes with the overhead of inter-process communication and managing separate memory spaces.\n",
        "Multithreading: Threads within a process share the same memory space, allowing direct access to shared data. This shared memory simplifies data sharing between threads but requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions and ensure thread safety.\n",
        "Resource Utilization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing can efficiently utilize multiple processors or CPU cores, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks or computationally intensive operations that can be parallelized.\n",
        "Multithreading: Multithreading is beneficial for I/O-bound tasks, where threads can overlap waiting for input/output operations. It can enhance the responsiveness and performance of applications that involve waiting for external resources like disk I/O, network requests, or user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Complexity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing introduces additional complexity due to separate memory spaces, inter-process communication, and coordination between processes. Proper synchronization and data sharing mechanisms are crucial to avoid issues like deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading: Multithreading within a single process is generally less complex than multiprocessing since threads share the same memory space. However, synchronization and thread safety must still be carefully managed to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity."
